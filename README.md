It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.


## Getting started

1. get the code from the repository

2. [download the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) that will be used to train a transaction classifier. Unzip it and put the content (creditcard.csv) under main folder (Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection)

3. install required python packages if previously not installed

4. Finally run on Jupyter Notebook .
